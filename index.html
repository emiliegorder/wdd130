            <p>I am 22 years old and currently live in Utah. My main hobbies include playing games with my family, reading, sewing, and fencing. I have three sisters and one brother. My favorie colors are green and pink. I love wildflowers and camping. I'm not sure what else to say so I'm goint to fill space with random words. I know I could use lorem ipsum but I don't want to so here we go instead. I really like this class so far and am excited to learn more about html and css. I hope to continue to have a great time learning how to program. Have I mentioned that I do archery on the second Saturday of the month. It's a lot of fun and I love the group I go with. I also play dnd every other Wednesday, and on Wednesdays that I'm not playing DnD I play Magic the Gathering. I'm a huge nerd and love all my nerdy friends. One of my friends is actually writing a book. She's going to get it published when its done, she's on the second draft right now and I'm really proud of her. What else can I say about me, I really enjoy musical theatre. I was a theatre kid in high school and also did backstage tech which was fun. I don't do it anymore but I still love to go watch live shows when I can. One of the best places I've been to see live theatre is the Hale Center Theater in Salt Lake. That was a really cool experience that I wish I could do again. Oh I also served a mission. I started in Kentucky but transfered to a service mission and ended in Utah. It was really great. Ok I think this is long enough now that it won't look weird next to the profile picture.</p>
